# NiagaraPoliticalTracker
 This project is aimed to provide and all-in-one platform to keep track of the actions of politicians actions in Niagara. Focusing on their support for bills and community policies 

This project will have three stages:

1) Set up HTML and CSS of the pages, including a main page, sub pages which will later include details about each MPP, MP and Premier, and serve as the foundation for later functionality updates.
2) Build an web scraper with an API that will collect latest voting results, twitter posts (where available) and any other relevant information.
3) Attached a SQL database to store all of the information and incorportate a search function.

Scope:
This website will collect and convey the available information related to the political information in the Niagara region. This decision is to limit scope creep. In order to best serve users in the region, accessibility will be a guiding principle in this project to ensure as few people as possible are alientated from accessing the website. I will be avoiding unecessary animations and low contrast so the website will work quickly on any device and be readable to those with visual limitations.
